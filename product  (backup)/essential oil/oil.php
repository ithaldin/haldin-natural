							<h3>Essential Oil</h3>
							<p>
								Today the use of essential oils has expanded into wider applications. Not only well known for their health benefits, 
								they also make an important contribution in the flavor and fragrance areas. Essential oils also play significant roles 
								in cosmetÂ­ics, perfumery, aromatherapy, personal care, and to a lesser extent, in household, cleaning agents and toiletries.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Essential oils, as the name refers, are concentrated hydrophobic liquids containÂ­ing volatile aromatic compounds, 
								which are extracted from natural plants. The botanical parts used to produce essential oils vary, from roots, rhizomes, bark or buds, 
								which are further processed depending on what type of plant is used. HowÂ­ever, the basic and the most appropriate extraction methods 
								are by distillation or solvent extraction. Large amounts of botanical material are used to extract the oils, since some plants have very 
								low yields of oil contained in their specialized oil cells.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Indonesia, as one of the world’s largest producers of essential oils, has long been producing key essential oils for the world market. 
								Some of the better known inÂ­clude: citronella, nutmeg, ginger, and ylang ylang. More recently as numerous boÂ­tanical plants native 
								to Indonesia have been studied and their functional properÂ­ties been better appreciated, more essential oils have been introduced and
								have started to be widely used. Amongst them are: patchouli, kaffir lime, sandalwood, cajuput, cananga, clove bud, and galangal.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Haldin as one of Indonesia’s leading extract producers has kept at the forefront in utilizing these rich Indonesian sources, by producing, 
								maintaining, and distributing essential oils globally.
							</p>

								Haldin essential oils are exhibit the same degree of purity and the same high standard of quality.
