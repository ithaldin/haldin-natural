                                            From start to finish, technical services put lots of their attempt to guarantee the product quality achieved. By monitoring and analyzing products with several parameters, Haldin technical services must ensure the finished products are within the specification, making sure those rigid requirements are met.

                                            Before raw materials are being processed, Haldin would do several checks, initially regarding the supplier requirement and the raw materials diagnose. It is done for us to be able to detect and check whether raw materials received are within our range of specification. From there, technical services would ensure that we only purchase those best quality raw materials. Once agreed, we would then transfer and give it to be produced by our related operating business units. When the production finished, it will be returned back to the technical services, the finished products must pass the quality test on product specification.

Several components being tested are; microbiological testing, total solid, active ingredients and the physical appearances which must pass our rigid requirement.

                                            When the products quality have been ensured and approved, technical services would issue the supporting data as the reliable & valid documentation. Those related data include; Certificate of Analysis or COA, Material Sheet Data Specification or MSDS and Product Specification. All data at the end will be documented and kept for specific period of time, depending on their use.
                                        </p></br>
